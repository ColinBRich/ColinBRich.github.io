            <p class="wordslyrics">i know i left you feeling shattered <br>
                too many pieces to count <br>
                i’m a hammer to your mirror <br>
                i’m a fist through the drywall <br>
                and it’s cruel to ask you to collect yourself <br> <br>

                i’m clouding your vision <br>
                you don’t wanna listen <br>
                no conversation could save us now <br>
                no sense in running running running <br>
                it’s been a long time coming <br>
                and it’s here now <br> <br>

                your eyes like a wounded creature <br>
                they’ll follow me on my way out <br>
                it’s a hollow worse than empty <br>
                a tide that slipped you under <br>
                a labyrinth you can’t escape or figure out <br> <br>

                we work with a shelf life <br>
                there’s never a right time <br>
                to say aloud what we’ve known for so long now <br>
                no sense in running running running <br>
                it’s been a long time coming <br>
                and it’s here now <br> <br>

                can’t come back from this damage <br>
                don’t try to understand it <br>
                no bandage could stop the bleeding out <br>
                no sense in running running running <br>
                it’s been a long time coming <br>
                And it’s here now<br>

                nothing i can say to turn your head <br>
                bring love back from the dead <br><br>

                Colder than your shoulder when i reached out for my one true lover disappeared into the sun <br>
                No i never loved noone <br>
                never loved noone <br>

                Drink it up<br>
                like you wanna drown <br>
                Took away my pretty crown <br>

                I know you know i’m out here <br>
                Circling your light <br>
                Torn by the sight <br>
                Lovelorn satellite <br><br>

                Colder than you shoulder when i reached out for my one true lover disappeared into the sun <br>
                No i never loved noone <br>

                Not to me <br>

                All behind my back <br>
                You set it in motion <br>
                So casually <br><br>

                I wonder what did i do <br>
                To deserve someone like you <br>

            <p class="wordslyrics">
                Never accused of being kind,<br>
                You show up like ivy in the garden of my mind <br>
                It’s not my fault that you got in <br>
                Sunbathing in the courtyard <br>
                When you climbed across the fence<br><br>

                Mmm and i cry <br>
                a little inside i know <br>
                it’s too good to be true<br>
                You’re no good<br>
                But the lie’s good as true<br>
                And the fake’s looking real<br>
                When it feels like you do<br><br>

                Take it all baby don’t look back<br>
                Take it all when you look like that<br>
                Take it all just like that<br>
                Take it all when you look like that<br><br>

                Maybe i’ll show up at the bars<br>
                I’ll run into you like stranger in the dark<br>
                And you’ll say, “oh, it’s been too long”<br>
                And your hand will say,<br>
                “I’m sorry that i ever did you wrong”<br><br>

                Mmm and i die!<br>
                A little each day that you don’t reply <br>
                And you make like a ghost<br>
                I should pack up and go<br>
                And move on or else i’m <br>
                Only haunting myself<br><br>

                Take it all baby don’t look back<br>
                Take it all when you look like that<br>
                Take it all just like that<br>
                Take it all when you look like that<br><br>

                Was it the god-awful complex<br>
                The hollow confidence<br>
                Catching the flash of your eye <br>
                On the pretty passersby<br>
                I pay it like a sin tax<br>
                And never see my money back<br>
                I didn’t ask for that!<br>
                It might defy all common sense <br>
                But i still feel your vines <br>
                around my wrist<br>
                Around my hips<br>
                On my lips, <br>
                You caught me<br>
                But i didn't ask for this.<br><br>

                Take it all baby don’t look back<br>
                Take it all when you look like that<br>
                Take it all just like that<br>
                Take it all away from me<br>
                And cover me in your ivy <br><br>

                Hard to see it go wasted potential <br>

                i followed down your darkness<br>
                i gave you things<br>
                i gave a noble witness<br>
                you hold it over my head<br>

                heal your hurting<br>
                how could i be so foolish <br>
                i said baby don’t do this<br><br>

                it’s like walking into battle with your eyes closed<br>
                when the ones you love hurt you the most<br>
                when it’s out of nowhere<br>
